This is a tribute to the great and wellmade map de_cbble by DaveJ,
with textures by MacMan. 
I tried to make some of the original cobble feeling remain and move
the theme to an aim scenario. Hope you enjoy my map. If you hate my
map, hate me, love my map or love me, just mail me and tell me 
what you think.
